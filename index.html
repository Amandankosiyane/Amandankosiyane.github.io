    <h2>Historic places in the V&A Waterfront</h2>
    <br>
        <h3>CLOCK TOWER HISTORY<h3/>
<br>
         
        <ul> <div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img id="clocktower" src="cllloccck Tooower.jpg" width="300" height="350" align="right"/>
            <li >The second floor of the Clock Tower is a decorative mirror room, where the Port Captain could check on all the activities in the harbor.<br> The bottom floor features a tide-gauge mechanism that was used to check the level of the tide.</li>
        <li>Restoration of the Clock Tower was completed in 1997, and is now an important focal point <br>in the Waterfront's urban design, and the Clock Tower Centre.</li>
        <li>A deck is constructed over the water, which allows visitors to view the Cape Fur Seals relaxing in the sun.</li>
        </ul>
     
         <hr/>
        <h3>TIME BALL TOWER</h3>
        
        <br>
      
          
        <ul>
            <div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img id="timeballtower" src="TTTimeball TTTower.jpg" width="300" height="350" align="left"/>
        <li> its purpose was to act as an accurate reference for ships' navigators who set their clocks as the ball on the roof fell.</li>
        <li>Built in 1894, the time ball in the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront remained in use for 40 years. In the period after that it was used as repeater station for harbour signals at some point. The tower was restored in November 1997.</li>
        <li>The time ball is an obsolete time signalling device. It consists of a large, painted ball that is dropped at a predetermined time, principally to enable navigators to verify their marine chronometers from their ships offshore.sss</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ROBINSON DRY DOCK</h3>
        
        <br>
        
    <ul>
        <div style="display:inline-block;text-align:left"><img  id="robindrydock" src="Rrrrrrooooobbbb.jpg" width="300" height="350" align="right"/>
        <li>The cross section of the dock reflects its original design for wooden sailing ships with bar keels and rounded bilges.</li>
       <li>Named after Governor Sir Hercules Robinson, it was used to repair over 300 ships during WWII.</li>
        <li>The Robinson Dry Dock in the Alfred Basin is the oldest operating dry dock of its kind in the world and dates back to 1882. The foundation stone for the dock was laid by Prince Alfred, second son of Queen Victoria.</li>
